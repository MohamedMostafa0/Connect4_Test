            showStartButton is a local bool that's needed because OnRoomServerPlayersReady is only fired when
            all players are ready, but if a player cancels their ready state there's no callback to set it back to false
            Therefore, allPlayersReady is used in combination with showStartButton to show/hide the Start button correctly.
            Setting showStartButton false when the button is pressed hides it in the game scene since NetworkRoomManager
            is set as DontDestroyOnLoad = true.
